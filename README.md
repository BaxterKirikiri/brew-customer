# Brew Overview

Brew is a system made of two React PWAs. One is used by the cafe operator and one is used by customers. The idea is that Brew replaces the use of physical loyalty cards with a digital app. The basic usage goes as follows: 1.) Customer signs in to the customer app on their phone.  2.) A QR code is generated that links to the cafe version of the app, containing the customers id.  3.) When the customer buys a coffee, the cafe operator scans the customers QR code, opening the cafe app and allowing them to adjust loyalty appropriately. 4.) The customer can check the app to see a real time representation of their loyalty progress.
